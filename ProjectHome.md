This is a mirror of the Vivisect debugger from Kenshoto, also known as VDB or Vtrace. The [original webpage](https://www.kenshoto.com/vtrace/) is often down, doesn't archive all past versions and provides no source control system, so this unofficial mirror is offered as a convenience.

That being said, you should always check the Kenshoto webpage first for the latest version, or follow [invisig0th](https://twitter.com/#!/invisig0th) on Twitter.

There is also a [community branch](https://code.google.com/p/vdebug/) of Vtrace being maintained in Google Code by [meddington](https://code.google.com/p/vdebug/people/detail?u=meddington) and [shadown](https://code.google.com/p/vdebug/people/detail?u=shadown), you should check it out too. You'll find unofficial patches and new features there. If you want to report bugs or have patches of your own, please submit them to the community branch.

This site mirrors the official Vtrace releases only.

**UPDATE** (March 29, 2011): There's a [new official page](http://visi.kenshoto.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) with an editable wiki, seems promising! :)

**UPDATE** (June 09, 2012): Vivisect has been released at SummerCon 2012! It's been a long wait, but it was worth it. :)
